### Hi there, I'm Calypso ðŸ™Œ 

I am a **Data Analyst** working to tell stories with data. I work mostly with Python, Pandas, Plotly, and Seaborn. 

You will find projects related to data analysis and vizualization in my repos. Look below to find projects that I am really proud of!

### I'm currently working on... ðŸ“Š 

Developing data analysis projects and finding a career to showcase my skills. 

To check out my portfolio, check out my other GitHub: [**CALY-PSO**](https://github.com/caly-pso/)

### What I am up to when I am not looking for a new dataset... ðŸŒ„ 

Exploring the beautiful trails of Colorado, and camping when the weather is right.
